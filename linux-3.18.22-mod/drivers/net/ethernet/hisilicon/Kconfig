# HISILICON device configuration

config NET_VENDOR_HISILICON
	bool "Hisilicon devices"
	default y
	depends on ARM
	---help---
	  If you have a network (Ethernet) card belonging to this class, say Y
	  and read the Ethernet-HOWTO, available from
	  <http://www.tldp.org/docs.html#howto>.

	  Note that the answer to this question doesn't directly affect the
	  kernel: saying N will just cause the configurator to skip all
	  the questions about Hisilicon devices. If you say Y, you will be asked
	  for your specific card in the following questions.

if NET_VENDOR_HISILICON

config HIX5HD2_GMAC
	tristate "Hisilicon HIX5HD2 Family Network Device Support"
	select PHYLIB
	help
	  This selects the hix5hd2 mac family network device.
