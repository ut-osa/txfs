* Marvell Armada 370/375/380/XP thermal management

Required properties:

- compatible:	Should be set to one of the following:
		marvell,armada370-thermal
		marvell,armada375-thermal
		marvell,armada375-z1-thermal
		marvell,armada380-thermal
		marvell,armadaxp-thermal

		Note: As the name suggests, "marvell,armada375-z1-thermal"
		applies for the SoC Z1 stepping only. On such stepping
		some quirks need to be done and the register offset differs
		from the one in the A0 stepping.
		The operating system may auto-detect the SoC stepping and
		update the compatible and register offsets at runtime.

- reg:		Device's register space.
		Two entries are expected, see the examples below.
		The first one is required for the sensor register;
		the second one is required for the control register
		to be used for sensor initialization (a.k.a. calibration).

Example:

	thermal@d0018300 {
		compatible = "marvell,armada370-thermal";
                reg = <0xd0018300 0x4
		       0xd0018304 0x4>;
		status = "okay";
	};
