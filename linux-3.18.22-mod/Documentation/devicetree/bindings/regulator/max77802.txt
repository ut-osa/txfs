Binding for Maxim MAX77802 regulators

This is a part of device tree bindings of MAX77802 multi-function device.
More information can be found in bindings/mfd/max77802.txt file.

The MAX77802 PMIC has 10 high-efficiency Buck and 32 Low-dropout (LDO)
regulators that can be controlled over I2C.

Following properties should be present in main device node of the MFD chip.

Optional node:
- regulators : The regulators of max77802 have to be instantiated
  under subnode named "regulators" using the following format.

	regulator-name {
		standard regulator constraints....
	};
	refer Documentation/devicetree/bindings/regulator/regulator.txt

The regulator node name should be initialized with a string to get matched
with their hardware counterparts as follow. The valid names are:

	-LDOn 	:	for LDOs, where n can lie in ranges 1-15, 17-21, 23-30
			and 32-35.
			example: LDO1, LDO2, LDO35.
	-BUCKn 	:	for BUCKs, where n can lie in range 1 to 10.
			example: BUCK1, BUCK5, BUCK10.
Example:

	max77802@09 {
		compatible = "maxim,max77802";
		interrupt-parent = <&wakeup_eint>;
		interrupts = <26 0>;
		reg = <0x09>;
		#address-cells = <1>;
		#size-cells = <0>;

		regulators {
			ldo11_reg: LDO11 {
				regulator-name = "vdd_ldo11";
				regulator-min-microvolt = <1900000>;
				regulator-max-microvolt = <1900000>;
				regulator-always-on;
			};

			buck1_reg: BUCK1 {
				regulator-name = "vdd_mif";
				regulator-min-microvolt = <950000>;
				regulator-max-microvolt = <1300000>;
				regulator-always-on;
				regulator-boot-on;
			};
	};
