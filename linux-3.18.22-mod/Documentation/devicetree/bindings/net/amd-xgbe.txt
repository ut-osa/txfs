* AMD 10GbE driver (amd-xgbe)

Required properties:
- compatible: Should be "amd,xgbe-seattle-v1a"
- reg: Address and length of the register sets for the device
   - MAC registers
   - PCS registers
- interrupt-parent: Should be the phandle for the interrupt controller
  that services interrupts for this device
- interrupts: Should contain the amd-xgbe interrupt
- clocks:
   - DMA clock for the amd-xgbe device (used for calculating the
     correct Rx interrupt watchdog timer value on a DMA channel
     for coalescing)
   - PTP clock for the amd-xgbe device
- clock-names: Should be the names of the clocks
   - "dma_clk" for the DMA clock
   - "ptp_clk" for the PTP clock
- phy-handle: See ethernet.txt file in the same directory
- phy-mode: See ethernet.txt file in the same directory

Optional properties:
- mac-address: mac address to be assigned to the device. Can be overridden
  by UEFI.
- dma-coherent: Present if dma operations are coherent

Example:
	xgbe@e0700000 {
		compatible = "amd,xgbe-seattle-v1a";
		reg = <0 0xe0700000 0 0x80000>,
		      <0 0xe0780000 0 0x80000>;
		interrupt-parent = <&gic>;
		interrupts = <0 325 4>;
		clocks = <&xgbe_dma_clk>, <&xgbe_ptp_clk>;
		clock-names = "dma_clk", "ptp_clk";
		phy-handle = <&phy>;
		phy-mode = "xgmii";
		mac-address = [ 02 a1 a2 a3 a4 a5 ];
	};
