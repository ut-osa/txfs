RT5677 audio CODEC

This device supports I2C only.

Required properties:

- compatible : "realtek,rt5677".

- reg : The I2C address of the device.

- interrupts : The CODEC's interrupt output.

- gpio-controller : Indicates this device is a GPIO controller.

- #gpio-cells : Should be two. The first cell is the pin number and the
  second cell is used to specify optional parameters (currently unused).

Optional properties:

- realtek,pow-ldo2-gpio : The GPIO that controls the CODEC's POW_LDO2 pin.

- realtek,in1-differential
- realtek,in2-differential
- realtek,lout1-differential
- realtek,lout2-differential
- realtek,lout3-differential
  Boolean. Indicate MIC1/2 input and LOUT1/2/3 outputs are differential,
  rather than single-ended.

Pins on the device (for linking into audio routes):

  * IN1P

Example:

rt5677 {
	compatible = "realtek,rt5677";
	reg = <0x2c>;
	interrupt-parent = <&gpio>;
	interrupts = <TEGRA_GPIO(W, 3) GPIO_ACTIVE_HIGH>;

	gpio-controller;
	#gpio-cells = <2>;

	realtek,pow-ldo2-gpio =
		<&gpio TEGRA_GPIO(V, 3) GPIO_ACTIVE_HIGH>;
	realtek,in1-differential = "true";
};
