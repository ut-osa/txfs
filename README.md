## The Texas Transactional File System (TxFS)

TxFS is a novel transactional file system that
builds upon a file systemâ€™s atomic-update mechanism
such as journaling. Though prior work has explored a
number of transactional file systems, TxFS has a unique
set of properties: a simple API, portability across different
hardware, high performance, low complexity (by building
on the journal), and full ACID transactions.
