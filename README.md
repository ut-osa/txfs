## The Texas Transactional File System (TxFS)

TxFS is a novel transactional file system that
builds upon a file systemâ€™s atomic-update mechanism
such as journaling. Though prior work has explored a
number of transactional file systems, TxFS has a unique
set of properties: a simple API, portability across different
hardware, high performance, low complexity (by building
on the journal), and full ACID transactions.

### In this repository

This repository includes two main components:

1. `linux-3.18.22-mod`. This contains the modified Linux kernel for TxFS. 
2. `benchmark`. Contains benchmarks used to evaluate TxFS.

Inside `linux-3.18.22-mod`, compiling the kernel follows the standard method of `configure` and `make`.  To see examples of TxFS in action, check out the examples inside `benchmark`.
